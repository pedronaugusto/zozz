//! Comptime cross-check: the hand-written externs in `c.zig` against the real
//! C header.
//!
//! `c.zig` is written by hand so the wrapper gets exactly the types it wants
//! and the shipped module never runs translate-c. The cost of hand-writing is
//! drift, and nothing in either compiler notices when this file's twin stops
//! matching `ffi/zozz.h`.
//!
//! This closes that by `@cImport`-ing the header — in a test only, so the
//! shipped module stays translate-c-free — and comparing the two namespaces
//! declaration by declaration. There is **no hand-written list of what to
//! check**: every public declaration in `c.zig` is discovered by reflection,
//! paired with its counterpart by naming convention, and compared. A
//! declaration that fits no category is a compile error rather than a silent
//! pass, so the check cannot quietly stop covering something.
//!
//! The naming conventions are therefore load-bearing, not cosmetic:
//!
//!   * a type `Foo`            pairs with `ZozzFoo`
//!   * a function `zozzFoo`    pairs with itself
//!   * a constant `foo_bar`    pairs with `ZOZZ_FOO_BAR`
//!   * an enum `Foo`'s field `bar` pairs with `ZOZZ_FOO_BAR`
//!
//! A declaration that breaks the convention fails this check, which is the
//! pressure that keeps the two sides legible as twins.
//!
//! ## What it does not catch
//!
//! translate-c renders every C pointer as `[*c]T`, while `c.zig` writes the
//! pointer it means (`*T`, `?*const T`, `[*]T`). Pointee types are therefore
//! compared only by size and alignment: a `float *` declared here as `*i32`
//! passes. `tests/c_smoke.c` drives the same scenarios as the Zig suite
//! through the header itself, which is what covers that residue.
//!
//! It also compares this build's externs against this build's *header*, not
//! against the *library*. The header is a source file and the library is a
//! binary; the two can describe different structs while looking identical.
//! `zozzAbiLayout`, asserted in `zozz.zig`, is what covers that axis, and
//! neither check replaces the other.
//!
//! ## Inline definitions
//!
//! `ffi/zozz.h` defines no functions inline, so every name it exports is a
//! real symbol and the reverse sweep can demand a declaration for all of them
//! without exception. If an inline helper is ever added, this sweep will
//! correctly report it as undeclared — the fix then is an explicit list of
//! inline names to skip, not a loosened filter.
