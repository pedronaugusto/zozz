# zozz — recompute every number the documentation claims.

# The README and TODO.md quote counts: entry points, tests, translation units,
# how long a full run takes. All of them are written by hand, and none of them
# has anything that notices when the code moves underneath. A count that is
# quietly wrong is worse than no count, because a reader has no way to tell.
#
# This prints what is actually true right now. Run it before touching a number
# in a document, and paste what it says rather than what you remember.
#
# It measures; it does not judge. Nothing here fails a build — the numbers are
# for prose, and prose is a human's job to keep honest.
