/// The two are genuinely different code paths. An in-repo test reaches the
/// module and the library through the same `std.Build` graph that created
/// them; a consumer reaches them through `b.dependency`, which resolves
/// artifacts by scanning the dependency's *install step* and installed headers
/// by their spelling. Neither of those is exercised by anything in `src/` or
/// `tests/`, so both can break while the whole suite stays green. Registering
/// an artifact behind `if (b.pkg_hash.len == 0)` is exactly that failure: it
/// looks correct, it builds, and `dep.artifact("zozz")` panics for everyone
/// downstream.
